        <p> My name is Alex Myers and im from Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a computer science major.
        <p></p> Im a single student, and love baseball, lacrossse and hockey! i as well love to play those sports and hike and go to amusement parks
        <p></p> So I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS and they're very useful if you want to start a phone company because then you're able to learn how to do your own website instead of having to pay someone to develop your own website for you. As well, it's a good skill to have just in case anyone you ever know might need it, so it's always good to learn different languages of code as you can use it for many versitale ways. I'm taking this class because it's one of my required classes and as well it's fascinating to learn about how to make your own website and perfect it.
